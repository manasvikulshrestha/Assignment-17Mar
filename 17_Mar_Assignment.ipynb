    "Q1: Missing values in a dataset refer to the absence of values for certain variables or observations. It's essential to handle missing values because they can lead to biased results, reduced statistical power, and inaccurate predictions if not addressed properly. Some algorithms that are not affected by missing values include tree-based algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost, as well as some robust regression techniques like Ridge Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: Imbalanced data refers to a situation where the classes in the dataset are not represented equally. If imbalanced data is not handled, machine learning models tend to be biased towards the majority class, leading to poor performance in predicting the minority class.\n",

    "Q4: Up-sampling involves increasing the number of instances in the minority class, while down-sampling involves reducing the number of instances in the majority class. Up-sampling and down-sampling are required to address class imbalance in the dataset. For example, if you have a dataset with 90% of instances belonging to class A and 10% belonging to class B, you may up-sample class B to balance the classes or down-sample class A.\n",

    "Q9: Strategies to evaluate model performance on an imbalanced dataset include using evaluation metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, employing techniques like cross-validation, and using resampling methods such as oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class.\n",
